ClockWork v1.3 (c) 2001 NiKe'Soft

  THIS IS YOUR LIFE
  & IT'S ENDING ONE MINUTE AT A TIME

  What is ClockWork? It's a simple Win9x (Windows 95/98/Me) 
TIMER Application. It ShutDowns your computer after selected time, 
even if DOS programs running.

I suppose that you have functional APM (Advanced Power Managment).
It's usually integrated in APX form-factor computers.
